    Simultaneus Localization And Mapping 
more of a concept than an algo. 
the idea is to build a map of the environment and move through the environment using that map all while continously updating the map. 

SLAM can be broken down into a few parts: 
        Landmark extraction 
        data association 
        state estimation 
        state update
        landmark update 

'odometry performance' measures how well the bot can estimate its position. Error should be less than 2cm per meter and 2deg per 45deg. 

Step 1 - Write algo to detect landmarks
